# TASK 1 - MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
A machine learning model to predict the genre of movies based on the description of the movie. Therefore, we are using TF-IDF that converts text into meaningful representation of integers that is used for prediction in the machine learning model. The Na√Øve Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for text classification.

# TASK 2 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
A machine learning model to predict whether a credit card is fraud or authentic. Therefore, we are using Logistic Regression algorithm which is a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts the occurrence of an event. In addition, Standard Scaler is used for standardizing the dataset.

# TASK 3 - CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
We are using a Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset to build a model for customer churn. Customer churn is where a customer has stopped using a particular product or service, whereas in here we are predicting if a particular will leave the bank or not. Therefore, we are using Random Forest Classifier which is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
